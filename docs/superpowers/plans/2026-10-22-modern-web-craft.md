# Modern Web Craft Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use executing-plans in this session, then an independent whole-branch review.

**Goal:** Ship actionable modern-web guidance, honest brief context and a verified responsive specimen through native Hermes.

**Architecture:** Extend the existing allowlisted reference and pure direction functions. Keep browser verification optional and conservative.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10+, standard library runtime; HTML/CSS/vanilla JS examples; pytest and Playwright development checks.

**Spec:** [Modern web craft](../../plans/modern-web-craft/design.md).

## Global constraints

- Five tool names and sixteen atlas IDs remain compatible; runtime dependencies remain empty.
- Preserve all current example interaction paths and conservative unknown-paint handling.
- No live profile, paid inference, release, merge or unrelated repository change.
- Context limits and field names are exactly those in the spec.
- Publication means a scoped branch and PR after tests/review, followed by terminal CI checks.

## Review focus

- Explicit empty/invalid context must fail honestly without throwing through the adapter.
- Caller-owned arrays must not be mutated or retained by reference in returned packets.
- Source, wheel resources, CLI and native topic/schema contracts must agree.
- Layout must adapt to container width, not just the outer viewport; disabled enhancements remain useful.
- Native integration and browser evidence must execute in isolation; skips are reported as gaps.

## Tasks

### 1. Reference recipes and feature ledger

Files: `hardlight/library.py`, `__init__.py`, `references/{layout,platform,performance}.md`, `data/platform-features.json`, `tests/test_platform.py`, skill and craft references.

- [ ] Add failing tests for new topics, ledger integrity and native topic/schema parity.
- [ ] Add versioned ledger and practical reference recipes with dated primary sources.
- [ ] Run reference, registration and package-resource tests; commit coherent reference change.

### 2. Brief context and host-authored design contract

Files: new `hardlight/brief.py`, `hardlight/direction.py`, native schema, CLI help, `tests/test_direction_context.py` and native integration fixtures.

- [ ] Add failing compatibility, validation, ownership, context-gap and dispatch tests.
- [ ] Implement bounded context validation and a clearly uncompleted design contract; preserve default style selection.
- [ ] Exercise CLI/native payloads, run focused tests and commit.

### 3. Set specimen and resilience evidence

Files: `examples/workspace.html`, `examples/README.md`, `tests/test_examples.py`, `tests/test_browser.py`.

- [ ] Add failing container/320px/text-resize/forced-color/fallback tests and modern-color unknown regression.
- [ ] Reformat Set, improve typography and layout using progressive enhancements, keep original tasks.
- [ ] Inspect actual wide/narrow/engaged screenshots, run existing and new interaction checks; commit.

### 4. Delivery and independent review

Files: README, research/verification notes, changelog, contribution guidance and evidence fixtures.

- [ ] Run full tests, lint, wheel/sdist build and installed-wheel smoke.
- [ ] Run isolated real Hermes load/dispatch/unload with both old and new inputs.
- [ ] Obtain independent review, repair substantive findings and verify fixes.
- [ ] Push scoped branch, open polished PR, attach it, wait for CI to finish and repair recoverable failures.

## Execution record

Implementation proceeds in an isolated branch with independent whole-branch review before publication. Reference/context tests were observed failing before implementation, then passed. The Set topology regression reproduced on the prior layout and passed after the container-based change. Browser tests use real keyboard navigation when checking focus-visible behavior. Full checks and remaining limits are recorded in `docs/verification.md`.
